# handwriting-classifier-in-the-browser
TensorflowJS project to classify the user's handwriting in the browser

This project is adapted from the coursera course [Browser-based Models with Tensorflow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/browser-based-models-tensorflow/home/welcome)
I modified the neural network structure to have more accurate predictions.

*PS: You need a web server to run this code. You can either add the chrome web server extension or manually create a web server in the code directory.
For instance:
```
python3 -m http.server
```
